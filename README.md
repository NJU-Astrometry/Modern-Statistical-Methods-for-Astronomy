# Modern-Statistical-Methods-for-Astronomy
This reposity is used to share codes used for solving statistical exercises in 
Appendix C of `'Modern Statistical Methods for Astronomy``.

It is also designed for searching for possible solutions to your problems
encountered in future work that are similar to exercises presented here.

Every one is encouraged to share their solutions, which might be implemented by
any methods you like, e.g., in Python or R.

Please put your codes under the directory ``sols/SUB_DIR`` and your plots 
under the directory ``figs/SUB_DIR``, where SUB_DIR represents the chapter 
name. An example could be ``1_Asteroids`` for ``C.1 Asteroids``.
